# Data Science Portfolio
Portfolio of data science projects completed for academic and self-learning purposes. 

## Contents

### Machine Learning
* [Modelling South Australia's Electricity Supply](../master/Reducing_Power_Supply_Costs_in_South_Australia.pdf): creating a deep neural network model that outperforms the industry benchmark by 11%. This model is also compared to traditional time-series models.
* [Modelling House Prices](../master/modelling-house-prices/models.ipynb): An analysis of several linear models to predict the value of a given house in the Boston real estate market. Identified the best price that a client can sell their house utilising machine learning. The associated report can be found [here](../master/modelling-house-prices.pdf).
* [Response to Direct Mail Marketing](../master/modelling-consumer-response.ipynb): Using classification techniques, such as logistic regression, discriminant analysis and KNN, to predict whether a consumer will buy a product based on the direct mail marketing they have received. The associated report can be found [here](../master/modelling-consumer-response.pdf).
* [Forecasting Retail Store Sales](../master/forecasting-rossmann-sales.ipynb): Using time-series modelling techniques, such as ARIMA and exponential smoothing, the amount (in dollars) of sales of a popular German retailer is forecasted. The associated report can be found [here](../master/forecasting-rossmann-sales.pdf).
* [Deep Learning to Predict ATM Cash Demand](../master/predicting-atm-cash.pdf): Using the Keras library built on top of Tensorflow develop a neural network to predict the daily cash demand for ATMs. 

### Data Analysis and Visualisation
* [Modelling House Prices](../master/modelling-house-prices/EDA.ipynb): Visualising how different features contribute to the pricing of a given house in the Boston real estate market. The associated report can be found [here](../master/modelling-house-prices.pdf).
* [Employee Turnover](../master/modelling-employee-turnover.ipynb): Analysis of the factors which contribute to employee turnover (Work in Progress).
* [Global Terrorism Analysis](../master/global-terrorism_analysis.ipynb): Analysis of terrorist attacks from 1970 to 2016 across the globe using Seaborn visualisations (Work in Progress).
